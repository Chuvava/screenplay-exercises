These exercises are part of the [Serenity Dojo](http://www.serenity-dojo.com/) training program, and are designed to help developers and testers learn how to work with Serenity Screenplay on real-world applications.

## The problem domain

In this series of exercises, we will be building up a test suite for a real-world web site: [SouthWestTrains](https://www.southwesttrains.co.uk/). Each tutorial will focus on implementing a particular test scenario. 

## Problem definition

The aim of this scenario is to view the available train trips between London Paddington and Oxford stations. You will be implementing the `booking_a_simple_trip` scenario in the `WhenPlanningATrip` class.
